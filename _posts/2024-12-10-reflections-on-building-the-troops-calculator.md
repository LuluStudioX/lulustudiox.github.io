## Diving Deep into the Troops Calculator Project

As a passionate gamer and data enthusiast, I’ve always been intrigued by how numbers can influence strategy and outcomes in games. Recently, I embarked on an exciting project that combined my interests: creating a Troops Calculator for a popular strategy game. This journey not only deepened my understanding of the game but also allowed me to share valuable insights with the community.

### Understanding the Required Math

The first step was diving into the game's mechanics. I meticulously analyzed the math behind troop training, resource management, and overall strategy. Breaking down complex calculations into manageable components was crucial. By grasping how different variables interacted—like training speed, capacity, and troop types—I laid a solid foundation for my calculator.

### Preparing My Excel Sheet

To organize my thoughts and calculations, I created an Excel sheet that served as a blueprint for my project. This sheet was instrumental in visualizing relationships between various factors and running simulations on different scenarios. It highlighted the importance of data organization in problem-solving—a skill that has proven invaluable in my academic and professional pursuits.

### Transitioning to Coding

With a clear understanding of the math and a structured plan in place, I transitioned to coding the calculator. Utilizing

<span class="icon-tech"><i class="fab fa-css3-alt"></i></span> **CSS**, 
I built an intuitive interface that allowed users to input their troop specifications and receive instant calculations on training times and resource costs.

### Technologies Used:

- <span class="icon-tech"><i class="fas fa-table"></i></span> Excel

### Overcoming Challenges

Throughout this process, I encountered challenges that tested my problem-solving abilities. From debugging code to optimizing user experience, each obstacle became a learning opportunity. Implementing features like cookie storage to save user inputs ensured players could revisit their calculations without starting from scratch.
